Welcome to my first attempt to use D3 to plot a map.

In this exercise, I contacted the department of history in
SÃ£o Paulo city, Brazil, in order to gain access to the list of monuments.
Although they prompt responded with a list, it was very unorganised with
many mixed information in the same fields. My first task was to clean the address
and add the long/lat information. The final CSV is a result of the GeoCode API, and
a bit of manual work for fixing small issues i.e. streets with same names in
different cities, resulting in a worng lat/long placement.
